  h2-hash About The Tutorials
  p The tutorials in the sidebar are ordered (from top to bottom) in a way that will help you understand Sockets quickly &mdash; from creating a server to interacting with it. Since all tutorials have example code of setting up and starting a socket server, it is not required that you read the tutorials in order. However, it is greatly recommended.
  hr
  h2-hash wscat
  p All tutorials have a Verification section where you will interact with a server. The Verification section requires that you install <code>wscat</code> globally. To install <code>wscat</code>, run the following command:
  code-block(title="Terminal")
    | npm install -g wscat
  p Once you have installed <code>wscat</code>, you can use it through the command line via <code>wscat</code> command.
  hr
  h2-hash The Definition Of A Channel
  p A channel is the same thing as a room or an event. In Sockets, we use the term "channel", so please keep that in mind.
  hr
  h2-hash Sending Messages
  p At times, you will be sending certain messages (as strings) in certain formats to a socket server. There are multiple messages that a Sockets server listens to. On receipt of one of the messages below, it will respond as stated below.
  ul
    li
      p
        strong <code>ping</code>
      p Sending a ping message will result in a pong message from the server.
    li
      p
        strong <code>pong</code>
      p Sending a pong message will result in a ping message from the server.
    li
      p
        strong <code>test</code>
      p Sending a test message will result in the server responding with the address it is listening at (e.g., Socket server is listening at 127.0.0.1:1777.).
    li
      p
        strong <code>connect_to</code>
      p This message allows you to connect to channels and is written as follows:
      code-block(title="Terminal")
        | {
        |   "connect_to": ["channel name", "another channel", "some other channel"]
        | }
    li
      p
        strong <code>disconnect_from</code>
      p This message allows you to disconnect from channels and is written as follows:
      code-block(title="Terminal")
        | {
        |   "disconnect_from": ["channel name", "another channel", "some other channel"]
        | }
    li
      p
        strong <code>send_message</code>
      p This message allows you to send a message to channels and is written as follows:
      code-block(title="Terminal")
        | {
        |   "send_message": {
        |     "to": ["channel name", "another channel", "some other channel"],
        |     "message": "some message"
        |   }
        | }
