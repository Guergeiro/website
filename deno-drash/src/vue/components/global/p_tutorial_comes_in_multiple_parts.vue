<template lang="pug">
p This tutorial comes in multiple parts. The parts are ordered in a way to help you build towards the <a-hash hash="end-state">end state</a-hash> from scratch. In each part, you will see a Folder Structure End State section. This section shows you what your project's folder structure should look like by the time you finish the part you are on. In addition, there will be a Verification section (the last section of each part) to help you match your end state to the tutorial's end state.
