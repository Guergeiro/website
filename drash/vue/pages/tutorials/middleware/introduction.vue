        p Drash defines middleware according to the MDN: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Middleware" target="_BLANK">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Middleware</a>.
        p Adding middleware to your application is useful when you want to filter requests throughout the request-resource-response lifecycle.

        h2-hash Middleware Types
        p There are two types of middleware in Drash: server-level middleware and resource-level middleware.
        h3#server-level-middleware Server-Level Middleware
        p Server-level middleware is middleware executed by the server on every request. You define server-level middleware when you create your server object. Server-level middleware can be executed before or after a request. Read the <a :href=" $conf.base_url + '/#/tutorials/middleware/introduction#setting-the-execution-location'">Setting The Execution Location</a> section below for more information on execution locations.
        p Take the example below. There is a set of server-level middleware that will execute before the request and after the request. <code>AuthMiddleware</code> and <code>CacheMiddleware</code> will execute before the request. <code>SomeOtherMiddleware</code> will execute after the request. These middleware classes will execute on every request.

        h3#resource-level-middleware Resource-Level Middleware
        p Unlike server-level middleware, resource-level middleware is specified using <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html" target="_BLANK">decorators</a> and a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file. Resource-level middleware can only be executed by resources. That is, if a resource is decorated with middleware, then the middleware specified in the decorators will be executed.
        p Take the example below. This resource contains two sets of middleware &mdash; class level and HTTP method level. With resource-level middleware, you can specify middleware to execute globally for all HTTP methods, or be more granular by decorating just an HTTP method.

        p There are two locations where middleware can be executed: before the request and after the request. View the <a :href=" $conf.base_url + '/#/lifecycle-diagram'">Lifecycle Diagram</a> for a visual representation.
        h3#before-the-request Before The Request
        p Middleware executed before the request means it is executed before a resource's HTTP method (e.g., <code>MyResource.GET()</code>, <code>MyResource.POST()</code>, <code>MyResource.DELETE()</code>) is called.
        h3#after-the-request After The Request
        p Middleware executed after the request means it is executed immediately after a resource's HTTP method (e.g., <code>MyResource.GET()</code>, <code>MyResource.POST()</code>, <code>MyResource.DELETE()</code>) is called and before a response is sent to the client that made the request.
        h3#setting-the-execution-location-of-server-level-middleware Setting The Execution Location Of Server-Level Middleware
        p You can have server-level middleware execute before and after the request by placing your middleware in the <code>before_request</code> array or <code>after_request</code> array. See the example below to see middleware defined in these arrays.

        p Middleware is executed in the order you define them. Take the examples below.
        p The server-level middleware would execute in the following order:
        ul
          li <code>OneMiddleware</code>
          li <code>TwoMiddleware</code>
        p

        p The resource-level middleware would execute in the following order:
        ul
          li <code>RedMiddleware</code>
          li <code>BlueMiddleware</code>
