  h2-hash Before You Get Started
  p A CLI wouldn't be complete without subcommands... Line offers the ability to plug in as many subcommands as you wish for your main command.
  p A subcommand is responsible for the functionality of your CLI.Using the quickstart as an example, adding "read" and "write" subcommands to your main command will allow your CLI to process those: <code>fm read</code>.

  h2-hash Creating A Subcommand Class
  p When you write a subcommand, it's the form of a class and is an extension onto Line's Subcommand class. Here is the list of properties and methods your subcommand classes can have and use:
  ol
    li
      p <code>signature</code> - This will explain how the subcommand should be used, and will be used in the <code>--help</code> option. For example if my subcommand was to write the contents of one file to another, the signature would be: <code>public signature: "write [src] [dst]"</code> (where "dst" means destination, and "src" means source)
      p <code>description</code> - The description of the subcommand, what will it do? What is the purpose? This will also be used in the <code>--help</code> option, for example: <code>public description: "Write the contents of one file to another"</code>.
      p <code>options</code> - This property is what holds the options for the subcommand (can also be called "flags"). It can contain a list of options (classes that extend Line's Options class) should you wish to support options for a subcommand. For more information, please refer to the options tutorial.
      p <code>handle()</code> - This method is the bread and butter of your subcommand. When you type <code>fm write file_1.ts file_2.ts</code>, this is what is invoked to handle the usage of the subcommand.

  h2-hash Example
  p Here is an example of how a subcommand class would be created:
  code-block(:header="false" language="typescript")
    | class WriteCommand extends Subcommand {
    |   public signature = "write [src] [dst]";
    |   public description = "Write the contents of one file to another";
    |   public options = [
    |     Option1, // adds a `--some-required-option` option for this command
    |   ];
    |   public handle(): void {
    |     if (this.getOptionValue("--some-required-option")) {
    |       throw new Error("The `-some-required-option` option is required"); // or can log the help option
    |     }
    |
    |     const source = this.getArgumentValue("src"); // matches the signature
    |     const destination = this.getArgumentValue("dst"); // matches the signature
    |     Deno.writeFileSync(source, destination);
    |   }
    | }
</template>
