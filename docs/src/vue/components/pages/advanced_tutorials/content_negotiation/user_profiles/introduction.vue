      p This tutorial assumes you have read the 
        a(:href="$conf.base_url + '/#/advanced-tutorials'") Advanced Tutorials Introduction
      p In this tutorial series, you will learn how to implement <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation" target="_BLANK">content negotation</a> in a Drash server. You will learn how to make a Drash server serve different representations of a resource. For simplicity, the only two representations this tutorial will cover are <code>application/json</code> and <code>text/html</code>. However, this tutorial will set your resource up in a way that will allow you to add more representations.
      p The resource you will be creating is a users resource. It will contain data about users and will be able to display a single user's data as a profile card in HTML or as JSON. The client (your browser in this case) will decide what representation to receive.
