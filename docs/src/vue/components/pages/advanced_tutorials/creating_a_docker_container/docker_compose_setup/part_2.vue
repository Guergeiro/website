      p Now that you have a working Drash server, you can add it to the docker orchestration. In this tutorial part, you will be creating new services for Docker to build and start, such as a Drash container and an Nginx or Apache container.

          p You have also specified a command for the Drash container to run when the container is up. In this case, that command will start the Drash server.
          p You should also note that the port for the Drash container is the same as the port the Drash server is running on in <code>/path/to/your/project/src/app.ts</code>.
