  p Rhum defines stubs as follows:
  ul
    li Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during tests
    li Stubs do not respond to calls outside the test's scope
  p Unlike mocks, stubs are used to help verify the state of a test.
  p Stubbing an object's properties can be done as follows:
  code-block(:header="false" language="typescript")
    | const myStubbedObject = Rhum.stubbed(new MyObject());
    | myStubbedObject.stub("some_property", "this property is now stubbed");
    | Rhum.asserts.assertEquals(myStubbedObject.some_property, "this property is now stubbed");
  p Stubbing an object's methods can be done as follows:
  code-block(:header="false" language="typescript")
    | const myStubbedObject = Rhum.stubbed(new MyObject());
    | myStubbedObject.stub("someMethod", () => { return "stubbed"; });
    | Rhum.asserts.assertEquals(myStubbedObject.someMethod(), "stubbed");
